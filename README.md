## Introduction

This theme is designed to bring vibrant colors and a retro feel to your Linux setup.

Currently, the following variants of the package are available:

- SPI.

## Features

## Installation

If you want to install the icon pack on your system, a few steps will need to be taken. Currently, you can install the theme manually by cloning this repository on your Linux environment.

### Step by Step

1. Clone this repository to your machine using the command below in your bash terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/Starciad/star-pixel-icons-theme.git" "SPI-Theme" --depth=1;
    ```

2. Now, access the newly created folder `SPI-Theme`. Once inside the directory, simply run the installation script:

    ```sh
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

> [!NOTE]  
> The PowerShell version does not exist since this package is compatible only with Linux graphical environments.

To completely remove the icon pack from your system, run the uninstallation script from the repository root:

```sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

The script will remove all the contents present in the SPI folder from your local icons directory.
